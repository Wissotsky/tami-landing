~~tami~~ everyone needs jumper cabelas.

unfortunately 90% of the jumper wires sold in open markets are
unreliable.

anyone using them might lose hours by faulty cables. (dont get me
started on store bought alligator connectors)

# Workshop

chat, and incidentally make jumper cables.

# Requirements
