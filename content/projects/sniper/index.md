#### booting NVME

on our gigabyte sniper Z97 motherboard, it was a amtter of updatding the
bios to F8 version.\
installing the distro (fedora) onto an SSD target then

    dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/nvme status=progress

alas, the nvme seems to be trash.\
it is very slow and sometimes doesnt get recognized at all
