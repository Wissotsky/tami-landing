# building an ultrasonic cleaner

This kit is NOT shoot and forget. it\'s very sensitive (and dangerous),
and DEPENDS on other parts,

1\. get an ultrasonic kit, made of driver/controller, and funny bell
shaped piezo things. They include weird little screws (\"nipples\").
We\'ll need them later.

2\. choose a water container based on the **shape** & size of items
you\'ll put in it. every extra litter of liquid takes more power (and
noise, and complexity).

3\. the kit comes with \"screws\" or \"bolts\". they need to be welded
to the container (from the outside), and the pizo-bell-shaped-thing are
screwed to them.

soldering isn\'t easy AT ALL since liquid containers are very thin.
suggestion: use silver welding, with matching flux. Pre-heat the
screw-things and find a way to keep them in the same place while
welding.

4\. before screwing around, scratch the attachment surface, choose solid
(non-elastic, non-flexible) glue, and apply to the entire contact area.

5\. requirements: timer (a must), fans (a must) switch, DC power supply
(for the fans) AC power - for the pizo-thing.

consider an on-off-555-like mechanism to turn the thing on and off
automatically, for long-duration operations.

6\. main problem is heat. So use fans (onlyfans.com for more info)

7\. grounding is important, in our 1 hour experiment, we burned 3 fuses,
and i got electrocuted (I guess the pizo-thing accumulated a serious
charge). Even with my shoes on. so ground the water container. the
driver/controller don\'t deal with grounding for some reason, so
grounding is up to you. i used the mains cable\'s ground.

8\. use screws and welding. the structure is vibrating, so simple
soldering or funny weak attachment WILL BREAK.

10\. seriously, make sure it\'s cold.

11\.

#### 9. testing:

put an aluminum foil in the water, and turn on. in few (?) minutes,
whole should appear in the foil.
