## Dough Recipe

The actual recipe gets tweaked every time I make it

The recipe is based on
[this](https://based.cooking/no-knead-pizza-dough/)

If you also want to make pizza start there

### Ingredients

-   400g AP flour
-   280ml water
-   2-4g instant yeast(FIXME explain further)
-   5g salt
-   20g msg
-   like 2 glugs of olive oil(FIXME get precise measure)
-   a handful of sugar(FIXME get precise measure)

### Directions

#### Wet

1.  Pour slightly warm water into bowl(around \~43C, should feel warm to
    the touch(FIXME explain why))
2.  Take some of the water, dissolve the sugar into it and pour it back
3.  Mix in the yeast
4.  ‚è∞ Wait \~10 minutes (Mix the dry ingredients(FIXME add link) now)
5.  Add the oil

#### Dry

1.  Mix the flour, salt and msg thoroughly (Sifting can make things
    slightly easier later on)

#### Mix

1.  Slowly incorporate the dry into the wet bowl
2.  Dont worry about forcefully mixing it in, let the dough sit and
    hydrate for(10-15 minutes atleast FIXME elaborate)(VERY IMPORTANT
    FIXME explain dough hydration)

#### Raising dough

(FIXME explain further all this complicated shit)

Let sit covered on the countertop for atleast 7 hours

Or in the fridge for longer(tapers off after 72 hours)

Slower development leads to better taste
